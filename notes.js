DEFINITION
--A data structure is way to store and organize data
so that it can be used efficiently
--A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships
among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data


WHY LEARN DATA STRUCTURES?
--Almost every application we build involves data that is
modelled in a certain way
--To efficiently manage the data, you need data structures
--Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient
organization of the books and they are stored randomly
--The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds
or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure
--Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in
terms of time and memory
--Learning about data structures also help you gain a more profound understanding
of things you're already aware of
--DOM - Tree data structure
--Browser back and forward - Stack data structure
--OS job scheduling - Queue data structure

OVERVIEW
--Built in data structures
Arrays
Objects
Sets
Maps
--Custom data structures
Stacks
Queues
Circular Queues
Linked Lists
Hash Tables
Trees
Graphs

ARRAY
--An array is a data structure that can hold a collection of values
--Arrays can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers
or even objects all in the same array
--Arrays are resizable. You don't have to declare the size of an array before creating it
--JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order is maintained
--Arrays are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop

ARRAY - BIG-O TIME COMPLEXITY
--Insert/Remove from end - O(1)
--Insert/Remove from beginning - O(n)
--Access - O(1)
--Search - O(n)
--Push/Pop - O(1)
--Shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice - O(n)
--forEach/map/filter/reduce - O(n)
